## Conflict Plan

## Communication Plan

We will begin every session with a stand-up to see where everyon is at, identify any blockers and outline our daily "sprints", referring to our group kanban.

We will signal attention by raising a hand if someone needs to speak or interrupt a busy workflow.

Until Monday evening, we will come in and work regularly scheduled hours on campus, to get to MVP. If we have not reached MVP by Monday evening, we will extend our working hours that we will outline during our standup at that time.

For help on features for which someone else is better versed in we will utlize the kanba-email, but also slack them right away!
