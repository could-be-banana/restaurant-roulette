# Conflict Plan

* What will your group do when it encounters conflict?

We will the idea before the group and give pros and cons and evaluate as a team.
We will also encourage eachother to take breaks to cool down or decompress since this can be a a very stressful time.

* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

We want to approach our friends with the benefit of the doubt and not be accusatory. We can frame our questions to reflect that. 
For Example:
"What can I do to make you feel involved in the project?" 
"What are you having trouble with?"

* What is your process to resolve conflicts?

As mentioned above, we will put ideas out for the group and try to come to concensus first, or a majority vote if we cannot. Since we are a group of 4, if we are unable to come to a concensus a TA or David will be a tie breaker.
If anybody is still heated over it, they can take a lap around the outside of the building.

* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

Again, as mentioned above, if we cannot come to agreement through processes we will escaltate the matter to TA first, and then to David, if necessary.
